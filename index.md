## Callie's PotD Handbook for Solo Machinists

Hi, this is my handbook for a Machinist to solo Palace of the Dead!
I've based a lot of this information on my attempts, [Maygi's Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQpzFuhmSwTXuZSmtnKLNgQ0nRhumCFaB8NvCXFXSjrBHPRT5lXY8jMR4RaCK1aNfcl_G5ph5DNNwfl/pub) and [AngelusDemonus' excellent videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u09C-EdSgDY)

My goal is to provide a quick reference for each floor set, to quickly remind me (and maybe you) what I can and can't fight as a solo Machinist, what has non-sight aggro mechanics, and which boss is coming up!

After 4 puddles it will run to the centre and cast "Fear Itself", an untelegraphed donut AoE which does a lot of damage and inflicts terror - stand in the centre with it to avoid

### The Boss
**TL;DR:** Use strength, Lust to 5 stacks and nuke it

Does periodic, easy to avoid AoEs. It eventually summons adds, and then shortly afterwards do an unavoidable AoE which inflicts terror, at this point if the adds are still alive they will likely kill you; while you are terrored it will also do a roomwide AoE, dealing more damage.

Ideally you should be at least level 58 as a MCH fighting this boss (for Drill) if not level 60.

If you have maxed aetherpool, you can kill it before the terror hits, if you are unsure, focus the adds when they spawn.

### The Boss
**TL;DR:** Stay close for donut AoEs, respect the Cold Feet glare, avoid AoEs

This boss casts In Health periodically as either a ring or a donut AoE, requiring you to run away from or towards her respectively. It's best to not kite too far away from her to be able to reach her for the donut variant. If you get hit by In Health, a rune on the floor with light up and future casts of her global AoE will deal more damage.

She also periodically uses a gaze attack called Cold Feet which should be avoided.

### The Boss
**TL;DR** Kite it around the edge. Places 2 puddles which inflict bleed, then summons orbs around edge and casts a knockback - get knocked into a spot without orbs.

This boss has a cycle where it will place 2 puddles which inflict bleed while you're standing in them, while this happens you should kite it around the outside of the room.

Once 2 puddles have been placed, it will summon orbs around the edge of the room with some gaps, then channel a knockback. You should position yourself to be knocked back to an area there are no orbs. After the knockback the orbs will explode and the boss will restart the cycle of placing puddles.

You can use Arm's Length to avoid the knockback, but this is mainly only useful if the bleed puddles are over both gaps in the orbs.
