## Callie's PotD Handbook for Solo Machinists

Hi, this is my handbook for a Machinist to solo Palace of the Dead!
I've based a lot of this information on my attempts, [Maygi's Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQpzFuhmSwTXuZSmtnKLNgQ0nRhumCFaB8NvCXFXSjrBHPRT5lXY8jMR4RaCK1aNfcl_G5ph5DNNwfl/pub) and [AngelusDemonus' excellent videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u09C-EdSgDY)

My goal is to provide a quick reference for each floor set, to quickly remind me (and maybe you) what I can and can't fight as a solo Machinist, what has non-sight aggro mechanics, and which boss is coming up!

It has a cleave which it will do periodically starting a few seconds in without warning which hits quite hard - be prepared with a potion, especially if at lower aetherpool levels

## Floors 21-30

### Mob Overview

Caution:

- Adamantoise - Has a good amount of health and hits reasonably hard, casts a medium sized AoE around itself periodically

Proximity:
- Marolith
- Wivre

Sound:
- Dullahan
- Skatene

### The Boss
**TL;DR:** Kite it around, don't stand in the puddles, every 4 puddles run to the centre for the Fear Itself cast

This boss is level 49. It will put down 4 puddles in the pattern fire, ice, fire, ice, you can kite it around to avoid its autoattacks and also the puddles

After 4 puddles it will run to the centre and cast "Fear Itself", an untelegraphed donut AoE which does a lot of damage and inflicts terror - stand in the centre with it to avoid

## Floors 31-40

### Mob Overview

Caution:
- Succubus - Does a telegraphed AoE terror around itself, followed by a damaging AoE cast - avoid these casts
- Monk - Does a pull in followed by an AoE, can be annoying, be wary around traps

Proximity:
- Mummy
- Monk
- Troubador
- Gourmand

Sound:
- Hecteyes
- Bogy

### The Boss
**TL;DR:** Use strength, Lust to 5 stacks and nuke it

Does periodic, easy to avoid AoEs. It eventually summons adds, and then shortly afterwards do an unavoidable AoE which inflicts terror, at this point if the adds are still alive they will likely kill you; while you are terrored it will also do a roomwide AoE, dealing more damage.

Ideally you should be at least level 58 as a MCH fighting this boss (for Drill) if not level 60.

If you have maxed aetherpool, you can kill it before the terror hits, if you are unsure, focus the adds when they spawn.
