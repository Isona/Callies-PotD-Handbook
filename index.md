## Callie's PotD Handbook for Solo Machinists

Hi, this is my handbook for a Machinist to solo Palace of the Dead!
I've based a lot of this information on my attempts, [Maygi's Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQpzFuhmSwTXuZSmtnKLNgQ0nRhumCFaB8NvCXFXSjrBHPRT5lXY8jMR4RaCK1aNfcl_G5ph5DNNwfl/pub) and [AngelusDemonus' excellent videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u09C-EdSgDY)

My goal is to provide a quick reference for each floor set, to quickly remind me (and maybe you) what I can and can't fight as a solo Machinist, what has non-sight aggro mechanics, and which boss is coming up!

**TL;DR:** Use strength, Lust to 5 stacks and nuke it

Does periodic, easy to avoid AoEs. It eventually summons adds, and then shortly afterwards do an unavoidable AoE which inflicts terror, at this point if the adds are still alive they will likely kill you; while you are terrored it will also do a roomwide AoE, dealing more damage.

Ideally you should be at least level 58 as a MCH fighting this boss (for Drill) if not level 60.

If you have maxed aetherpool, you can kill it before the terror hits, if you are unsure, focus the adds when they spawn.

### The Boss
**TL;DR:** Stay close for donut AoEs, respect the Cold Feet glare, avoid AoEs

This boss casts In Health periodically as either a ring or a donut AoE, requiring you to run away from or towards her respectively. It's best to not kite too far away from her to be able to reach her for the donut variant. If you get hit by In Health, a rune on the floor with light up and future casts of her global AoE will deal more damage.

She also periodically uses a gaze attack called Cold Feet which should be avoided.

### The Boss
**TL;DR** Kite it around the edge. Places 2 puddles which inflict bleed, then summons orbs around edge and casts a knockback - get knocked into a spot without orbs

This boss has a cycle where it will place 2 puddles which inflict bleed while you're standing in them, while this happens you should kite it around the outside of the room.

Once 2 puddles have been placed, it will summon orbs around the edge of the room with some gaps, then channel a knockback. You should position yourself to be knocked back to an area there are no orbs. After the knockback the orbs will explode and the boss will restart the cycle of placing puddles.

You can use Arm's Length to avoid the knockback, but this is mainly only useful if the bleed puddles are over both gaps in the orbs.

## Floors 61-70
### Mob Overview
Good to Fight:
- Everything

Proximity:
- Wivre
- Diplocaulus
- Triceratops
- Pteranodon

### The Boss
**TL;DR:**: Kite it around the edge, keep it out of puddles

This boss will periodically use a skill called Douse which will spawn a puddle underneath it, while stood in these puddles the boss gains a haste buff. It's worth noting that these puddles won't harm you if you stand in them.

It also periodically casts a slow debuff and then an AoE - the slow has diminishing returns so halves in length each time you get it. It's worth using sprint a few seconds after getting the first debuff to avoid the first AoE it does afterwards.

- Everything

Proximity:
- Dhalmel
- Sasquatch
- Bird

### The Boss
**TL;DR:** Thunderbolt, Charybdis, Thunderbolt, Trounce from East, Thunderbolt, Charybdis, Thunderbolt, Trounce from West - Repeat. Meteor cast at 10%

This boss has a fixed cycle in which it does its attacks. It will use Thunderbolt, a close range conal attack. Then it will cast Charybdis, spawning a cyclone which pulses periodically for larger than the cyclone itself. Then it will use Thunderbolt again. Then it will run to the Eastern side of the room and use Trounce, a large conal attack. It will then repeat this pattern, but will use trounce from the Western side of the room instead, switching between East and West.

At 10% health, it will soft enrage and begin spam casting Ecliptic Meteor, which will deal 80% of your health in damage if the cast goes off. Try to kill it before the second cast, but there's plenty of time, so don't panic!
